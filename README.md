### Using MijnUI Components with Next.js

This repository showcases how to use MijnUI components with Next.js. Itâ€™s based on [Kiranism/next-shadcn-dashboard-starter](https://github.com/Kiranism/next-shadcn-dashboard-starter), but with customizations to highlight MijnUI.

A few things to note:

- **MijnUI** is currently in beta and not ready for production. Weâ€™re actively working on improvements, and your feedback is more than welcome!
- Some components, like charts, are from [Shadcn/UI](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) since we havenâ€™t created them yet.
